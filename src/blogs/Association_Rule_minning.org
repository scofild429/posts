#+STARTUP: overview
- Transaction: T, one behavior, which accomplished a lot of things(items)
- Item : I, which stands for the smallest unit, that can be done.
- Our task is to find out, the relationship between items

*Confidence*
$$C(a->b) = P(b|a) = \frac{P(ab)}{P(a)}$$
#+begin_src 
the Probabilities  If a is done, b will also be done.
#+end_src

*Support*
$$S(a->b)=P(a\cap b) = P(ab)$$
#+begin_src 
a and b be done together from all Transaction, identify the special Transaction case
#+end_src

$$X -> Y(C=c, S=s)$$

*practicability* (Lift)
$$L(a->b)=\frac{Confidence(a->b)}{P(b)} =\frac{P(ab)}{P(a)P(b)}$$
#+begin_src 
The impact of a on b to be done
#+end_src


*Aprioir* *algorithm*

1.(with support level(S) )
- find the frequently itemset(L)
- the subsets of frequently itemset is also frequently itemset
- collect the total Transaction set(T), and set the the support level
- find all $L_{1}$, which satisfied S,
- find all $L_{2}$, which come from all 2-items combinations, which satisfied S
- .....to only one left, $L_{k}$.

2.(with Confidence (C) )find all subsets of $L_{k}$, which satisfied C.

*Note* all the operations in this 2 step is done in the whole Transaction sets
